# Quilt

Quilt enables anyone to deploy complex applications to the cloud
by encoding expertise about how to run those applications in JavaScript
_blueprints_.

This site describes how to use Quilt. It describes how to
install Quilt to run a blueprint, and also how to write your own blueprint
for a new application.
